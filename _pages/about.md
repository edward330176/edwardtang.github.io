Hello, and welcome to my page! My name is Edward Tang. I am an aspiring data scientist with a passion for using data to uplift lives!

## Career Objectives
I received my master's degree in data science from the **University of Denver**. I am particularly interested in image and natural language processing and their applications in the medical field. Currently, I am a researcher at **Macau University of Science and Technology**, where I employ both machine learning and deep learning methods to better understand user-generated content (UGC). With over 15 months of research experience, I am seeking to pursue a PhD in data science from the **Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS)** at **New York University**. My goal is to conduct innovative research on developing advanced AI technologies to assist in medical imaging, diagnostics, and beyond. 

## Personal Interests
In my leisure time, I enjoy reading self-improvement books. I have created a dedicated page to list all the books I have read and enjoyed so far. I hope you all enjoy this reading feast!
